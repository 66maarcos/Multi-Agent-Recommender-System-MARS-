## üìñ Introduction

The MARS project integrates advanced technologies to create a seamless experience for users seeking movie recommendations. By utilizing a collaborative AI architecture, MARS combines the strengths of specialized agents, large language models (LLMs), and a custom vector database. This system ensures accurate content-based search capabilities through semantically rich embeddings derived from movie plots and genres.

## üöÄ Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: MARS learns user preferences to provide tailored movie suggestions.
- **Factual Information**: Users can ask for detailed information about movies, actors, and genres.
- **Collaborative AI**: Multiple specialized agents work together to enhance the recommendation process.
- **Advanced Search**: Leverages semantically rich embeddings for improved search accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use chatbot interface for interaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Google Gemini**: Large language models that enhance conversational capabilities.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques used to understand and generate human language.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Framework for developing systems with multiple interacting agents.

## üöß Getting Started

To set up the MARS project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/66maarcos/Multi-Agent-Recommender-System-MARS-
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Multi-Agent-Recommender-System-MARS-
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üíª Usage

To run the MARS chatbot, execute the following command in your terminal:

python main.py
```

Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it through the console or any configured user interface.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

MARS employs a modular architecture consisting of several key components:

1. **User Interface**: The front-end through which users interact with the chatbot.
2. **Agent Layer**: Multiple specialized agents handle different tasks, such as recommendations and information retrieval.
3. **LLM Integration**: Google Gemini models process user queries and generate responses.
4. **Vector Database**: FAISS stores movie embeddings, allowing for efficient similarity searches.
